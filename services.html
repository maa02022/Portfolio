            <b>1. Custom software development: </b>It is a structured process that entails a series of actions and
            associated results used in the creation of software. Custom software development can frequently be carried
            out internally or externally and under a software services list. The client must take into account the
            reputation and track record of potential outsourcers if in-house development is not feasible.<br /><br />

            <b>2.Software Prototyping, </b>that is the process of repeatedly building incomplete versions of an
            application to advance its development. Similar prototyping procedures are used in industries like
            manufacturing and mechanical engineering. The majority of the time, a software prototype only executes a
            small subset of the necessary functions and may differ significantly from the finished product.<br /><br />
            <b>3. DevOps Automation: </b>It is the practice of integrating software development and operations —
            typically two distinct tasks in a conventional data center. Shortening the SDLC and consistently delivering
            high-quality software are the main objectives of DevOps.<br /><br />
            <b>4. Web Application Development: </b>It is an extension of traditional software development with unique
            characteristics such as a greater need for iterative development. Due to their much greater vulnerability to
            attack, web applications pose a bigger security risk than conventional desktop applications. <br /><br />
            <b>5. Quality Assurance: </b>It is an investigational procedure that informs stakeholders of the caliber of
            an application. Additionally, it gives the client a free analysis of the dangers involved in using the
            software services list. Techniques used in software testing include confirming that the software can perform
            necessary tasks and identifying tasks that it can’t perform but may not be necessary for the user.<br /><br />
            <b>6. Systems Integration: </b>It combines the components of a system to give it its overall functionality.
            These components are integrated using a variety of methods, such as business process management, networking,
            and even manual programming.<br /><br />
